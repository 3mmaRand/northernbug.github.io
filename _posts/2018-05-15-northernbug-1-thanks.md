Thank you for joining us in York yesterday for Northern BUG 1. It was great to meet you all!

Please feel free to post anything you think would be relevant.

Preparations for the next meetings are well under way - please write to the Google group or Matt Parker, Mark Dunning, Dennis Wang or myself if you have any thoughts on that.

Once again, thanks for helping to make yesterday such good fun - long may it continue.
