Big thank you to everyone who has already registered to attend the next NorthernBUG meeting. We are still open for people to register their attendance.

We also still have a number of presentation slots available, 10 minutes and 20 minutes duration. We encourage anyone interested to consider presenting their current work or a discussion regarding relevant topics for this meeting. The material by no means has to encompass a completed project and can definitely be based on something live and incomplete - if you want input, help with a pipeline or would like to raise even a theoretical problem, please feel free to submit your talks to us. We will try and accommodate as many speakers as possible.

If you have not done so already, you can sign-up for free at the below link. You can specify that you wish to present after pressing the 'Register' button and choosing 'Presentation slot'. If you have already registered but would like to present, or just want to get in touch, please feel free to e-mail yura.grabovska@newcastle.ac.uk
