# Discussion 

_Thanks to [Katherine Newling](https://twitter.com/KatherineNewlin) for taking notes of the discussion_.

In the discussion at the end of the meeting, we discussed the future of NorthernBUG 1 and other ways for delegates to collaborate. Deena Gendoo suggested that we collaborate through shared teaching, maybe via a shared repository of teaching materials. Mark Blaxter (MB) pointed to [Elixir](http://elixiruknode.org) as an existing repository and Dennis Wang suggested building from [Mark Dunning's existing repository](https://github.com/bioinformatics-core-shared-training). Ian Sudbery (IS) suggested a list of people willing to deliver training sessions at other institutions would be useful. MB suggested discussions could take place on the Google Group or a repository to assess what the key course material should be for a particular topic, eg what are the essentials in any RNA-seq course?

IS asked MB if there were themes in [NextGenBUG](http://nextgenbug.org) meetings. MB said yes, often organised around invited speakers, and with associated workshops, e.g. for the half day before the meeting, people meet to try out a new tool together.

Simon Cockell (SC) asked about funding. John Davey (JD) said first meeting cost ~Â£1500 for food, venue and speaker expenses, but that a minimal meeting could be booking a lecture theatre for free and just booking coffee without lunch. MB said finding sponsorship takes time and should be done straight away. Check for local funds; PhD students may be able to apply to grad student funds. Dave Lunt suggested asking the Genetics Society. 

JD said the first meeting had many short talks to hear from lots of different institutions, but he preferred a more relaxed meeting with fewer longer talks. Roy Chaudhuri said the first meeting had worked well and we should continue to have short introductory talks.

JD asked about timing and frequency of meetings. There was general agreement that one afternoon every 3-4 months was fine. JD suggested moving the meeting slightly earlier so people could return home by the end of the working day, but SC and others said there was no good timing that fit within the working day for those coming from the edges of the region, and an afternoon meeting was fine. RC suggested that we could also host online meetings using Google hangouts or similar (as for [Balti and Bioinformatics](http://lab.loman.net/microbiology/bioinformatics/balti/2014/09/06/balti-and-bioinformatics-on-air-wednesday-september-10th-2014/) in previous years).

Next meetings: Dennis Wang and Mark Dunning will hold Northern BUG 2 in Sheffield on 14 September 2018. Simon Cockell will investigate hosting in Newcastle in December/January, and Deena Gendoo offered to look into hosting at Nottingham Trent in early 2019.
