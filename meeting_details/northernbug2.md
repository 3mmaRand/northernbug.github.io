# General

The [Sheffield Bioinformatics Core](http://sbc.shef.ac.uk/) are excited to host the 2nd
NorthernBUG meeting. We'll have 6 short talks, 3 from students and 3 from other BUG memebers. Hopefully there will be a talk from sponsored speaker, one application talk and one *keynote* talk.

We will have a form soon to register your interest in doing a talk.

> Logical Factorisation Machines - a family of Boolean logic
models for high-dimensional binary data dimensionality reduction

Abstract: Binary data are often treated as continuous measurements so
that standard dimensionality reduction methods designed for continuous
data can be applied. This results in ambiguous low-dimensional
representations since the observations are binary but the reduced
dimensional representation is continuous. An alternative in which the
latent low-dimensional representation is itself binary maybe more
desirable. We have developed a family of binary data dimensionality
reduction techniques based on Boolean logic called Logical
Factorisation Machines (LFMs). In this talk I will describe the family
of LFMs, the properties that give rise to scalable computation and
applications in single cell genomics for interpretable unravelling of
latent expression pathways.
