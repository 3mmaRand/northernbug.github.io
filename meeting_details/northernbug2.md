> **Logical Factorisation Machines - a family of Boolean logic
models for high-dimensional binary data dimensionality reduction**  Abstract: Binary data are often treated as continuous measurements so that standard dimensionality reduction methods designed for continuous
data can be applied. This results in ambiguous low-dimensional
representations since the observations are binary but the reduced
dimensional representation is continuous. An alternative in which the
latent low-dimensional representation is itself binary maybe more
desirable. We have developed a family of binary data dimensionality
reduction techniques based on Boolean logic called Logical
Factorisation Machines (LFMs). In this talk I will describe the family
of LFMs, the properties that give rise to scalable computation and
applications in single cell genomics for interpretable unravelling of
latent expression pathways.
