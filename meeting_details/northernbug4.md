# General

NorthernBUG 4 will be held at the University of Bradford on Friday 26th April 2019, starting at 12pm with lunch and finishing at 5pm, followed by drinks at a local pub.

Registration will be opened shortly as we are currently finalising the planned schedule.

Suggestions from the Northern BUG3 included: 

- Posters & Teaser/Lightening talks (2 mins) to encourage PhD students, postdocs and ECRs to get involved
- Break-out session potentially including 'how-to' sessions and discussing/sharing teaching resources 
- Traditional talks too!

We'd appreciate everyone's opinion on these and also any other suggestions so please reply below or post in the Google group.

Please save this date in your calendars and watch this space for more info!
